                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
                    <h4>FrontEnd</h4>
                    <li>HTML: Used to structure the web pages, presenting event details, registration forms, and user dashboards.
                        CSS (including Tailwind CSS): Styled the application's UI components, ensuring responsiveness and a modern aesthetic. Tailwind CSS utility classes were leveraged for rapid prototyping and consistent styling.</li>
                    <h5>BackEnd</h5>
                    <li>Java: Backend development language chosen for its versatility, performance, and extensive libraries. Java handles business logic, data processing, and integrates with the frontend through RESTful APIs.
                        Hibernate: Object-relational mapping (ORM) framework utilized to streamline database interactions. Hibernate simplifies data persistence and retrieval, mapping Java objects to database tables seamlessly.</li>
                    <h6>Database</h6>
                    <li>MySQL (or another relational database): Backend data storage solution. MySQL manages event details, user registrations, and administrative data. SQL queries facilitate efficient data retrieval, updates, and reporting.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
